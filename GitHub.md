*HacktoberFest* is a month long celebration in October (as the name suggests) every year. It is for the millions of people who either contribute or are willing to contribute to open source. This is run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

You need to make minimum of 4 pull requests to contribute to open source. The first 70,000 valid PRs are considered. If your PR counts for a valid one, you are one step closer to achieve HacktoberFest Swags and HacktoberFest T-shirt.
